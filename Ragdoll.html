    <hr>
    <h2>Brief introduction</h2>
    <p>The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat.The Ragdoll is effectively a man-made breed, created in the early 1960’s by Anne Baker, a cat breeder in California. Anne used an Angora type cat, a seal mitted (white gloves and boots over a Siamese type colour) male and a solid black cat to produce her foundation Ragdolls. The name 'Ragdoll' is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.</p>

Their color rings are commonly tricolor or bicolor.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature.<br/></p>
    <p>Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats", due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggressiveness towards other pets.Ragdolls are curious, and quite inclined to assist in your day-to-day activities, but would prefer to sit on your book or paperwork or watch from a sunny spot whilst you garden, rather than anything too strenuous.</p>

    <h2>Ragdoll Cat Care</h2>
    <ol>
                            
        <li>Brush at least twice a week to help avoid tangles.</li>
        <li>Like all other cats, ragdolls also generally need nail trims.</li>
        <li>Do not just leave toys around for your kitty, though, as it's best to get up and play together. This will help keep your cat’s weight down and build bonds within the family.</li>
